# ClientServerUDP
This repository contains client server communication using UDP protocol. This contains two questions.

# Question 1
Write a pair of UDP client/server programs showing the two-way communication between client and server. Each message should display the number of bytes of the message received.

# Question 2
Design UDP iterative Client Server application to reverse the given input string. An iterative server is the one that deals with one client at a time but never Exit. (Client will send the string, server will reverse and display the output)
